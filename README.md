# jmsk-badge-days-until
During our [hacktoberfest](https://youtu.be/WFnwpnR983s) livestream. We got onto the subject of building a way to create a custom badge for things, not covered in [shields.io](https://shields.io). We were quickly able to create a proof of concept that creates [a badge](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://jmsk-badgeio-days-until.azurewebsites.net/api/badgedaysuntil) telling you how many days until the next Sarah and Jay stream.

The badge looks like this!
